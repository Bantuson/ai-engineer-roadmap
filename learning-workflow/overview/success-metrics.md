## Adjustment Protocol

### If Falling Behind

1. **Identify the blocker**
   - Time management?
   - Concept difficulty?
   - Energy/motivation?

2. **Prioritize ruthlessly**
   - Must-haves first
   - Nice-to-haves can wait

3. **Adjust scope, not quality**
   - Better to do 8 projects well than 10 poorly
   - Focus on understanding over completion

4. **Use weekends for catch-up**
   - Sunday capstone time is flexible

### If Ahead of Schedule

1. **Deepen understanding**
   - Additional eval scripts
   - More security testing
   - Extra DSA problems

2. **Document more thoroughly**
   - Better portfolio artifacts
   - Cleaner code

3. **Start next phase early**
   - OOP refactoring
   - Capstone 02

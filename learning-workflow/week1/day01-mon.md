- [ ] Survey design basics

### DSA: Arrays Introduction (2.5h)
**Problems (Easy):**
1. Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
2. Contains Duplicate (LeetCode #217)
3. Maximum Subarray (LeetCode #53)

**Patterns to Learn:**
- Hash map for O(1) lookup

## Prompt Drills

### Drill #1: Agent Design (08:00-08:30)
**Topic:** Role Definition Basics

1. **Prompt 1:** Define a creative writer agent
   - What role should it have?
   - What capabilities?
   - What constraints?

2. **Prompt 2:** Define a fact-checker agent
   - How does it complement the writer?
   - What sources should it use?

3. **Prompt 3:** Define an editor agent
   - What is its relationship to the writer?
   - What quality criteria?

### Drill #2: Prompt Techniques (08:30-09:00)
**Topic:** Few-Shot Learning

4. **Prompt 4:** Create a few-shot prompt for classification
5. **Prompt 5:** Create a few-shot prompt for summarization
6. **Prompt 6:** Create a few-shot prompt for translation

### Drill #3: Security/Evaluation (14:00-14:30)
**Topic:** Input Validation Basics

7. **Prompt 7:** How would you validate user input for a story theme?
8. **Prompt 8:** What malicious inputs might users try?
9. **Prompt 9:** Design a prompt that rejects off-topic requests

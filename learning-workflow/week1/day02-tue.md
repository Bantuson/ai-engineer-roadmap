## Learning Objectives

### Reading: Threat Landscape (1h)
- [ ] Read `vulnerabilities/01-threat-landscape/README.md`
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 for LLMs overview
- [ ] Attack surface mapping basics

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are the most common LLM vulnerabilities?
- How is AI security different from traditional security?
- What is an attack surface for an AI system?

### Python Challenge (Days 3-4)
- [ ] JSON loading and dumping
- [ ] Working with nested JSON data
- [ ] CSV reading and writing
- [ ] DictReader for CSV

**Exercises:**
1. Load a JSON file and extract specific values
2. Create nested JSON and save to file
3. Read a CSV and calculate column averages
4. Convert JSON to CSV and back

### Mini-Project: CrewAI Deep Dive (2h total)
- [ ] Study the agent definitions in YAML
- [ ] Study the task definitions
- [ ] Trace the execution flow
- [ ] Modify story theme, observe changes

**Goals:**
- Understand how roles are defined
- Understand how tasks chain together
- See how output from one agent feeds another

### PM: User Research (2h)
- [ ] Complete `01-user-research.md`
- [ ] User interview techniques
- [ ] Survey design basics
- [ ] Persona creation

### DSA: Arrays Continued (2.5h)
**Problems:**
1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode #121)
2. Product of Array Except Self (LeetCode #238)
3. Maximum Product Subarray (LeetCode #152)

**Patterns:**
- Tracking min/max values
- Prefix/suffix products
- Dynamic tracking

## Prompt Drills

### Drill #1: Agent Design (08:00-08:30)
**Topic:** Task Specification

1. **Prompt 1:** Define a research task for an agent
2. **Prompt 2:** Define an analysis task
3. **Prompt 3:** Define a synthesis task

### Drill #2: Prompt Techniques (08:30-09:00)
**Topic:** Chain of Thought

4. **Prompt 4:** Create a CoT prompt for math problem
5. **Prompt 5:** Create a CoT prompt for debugging
6. **Prompt 6:** Create a CoT prompt for decision-making

### Drill #3: Security/Evaluation (14:00-14:30)
**Topic:** Input Validation

7. **Prompt 7:** How would you validate user input for a story theme?
8. **Prompt 8:** What malicious inputs might users try?
9. **Prompt 9:** Design a prompt that rejects off-topic requests

### The Product Lifecycle Framework

Every product moves through predictable stages. Understanding where your product sits fundamentally changes what you should focus on.

### Stage 1: Introduction

**What it looks like:**
- Product is new to market
- Small but potentially passionate user base
- Revenue is minimal or negative (investment phase)
- High uncertainty about product-market fit

**Real examples:**
- Early Twitter (2006-2008): Exploring what the product even was
- Clubhouse (2020): Explosive interest, unclear staying power
- New startup MVPs finding their first users

**PM priorities in Introduction:**

| Priority | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Finding product-market fit | Nothing else matters if users don't want this |
| Rapid iteration | Learn fast, pivot if needed |
| User conversations | Qualitative insight over quantitative data |
| Defining success metrics | Know what "working" looks like |

**What PMs should NOT focus on:**
- Scale and optimization (premature)
- Complex processes and documentation (slows learning)
- Perfecting features (learn before polishing)

**Key question:** "Do people actually want this?"

**Success indicator:** Users who voluntarily return and express genuine disappointment if the product disappeared.

### Stage 2: Growth

**What it looks like:**
- Product-market fit is established
- User base is expanding rapidly
- Revenue is increasing (often exponentially)
- Competition is noticing and responding

**Real examples:**
- Slack (2014-2019): Viral adoption across teams and companies
- Zoom (2017-2020): Accelerated by pandemic, but already growing
- Instagram post-acquisition: Hypergrowth to 1B users

**PM priorities in Growth:**

| Priority | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Scaling systems | Infrastructure must handle 10x growth |
| User acquisition optimization | Maximize growth rate while quality holds |
| Feature expansion | Address adjacent user needs |
| Team and process development | Chaos doesn't scale |

**What PMs should NOT focus on:**
- Questioning product-market fit (you have it, run with it)
- Being precious about early decisions (adapt to scale)
- Ignoring technical debt (it compounds fast)

**Key question:** "How do we grow as fast as possible without breaking?"

**The growth trap:** Many products optimize for growth metrics that don't create long-term value. User count means nothing if retention is poor.

**Success indicator:** Consistent month-over-month growth with healthy retention metrics.

### Stage 3: Maturity

**What it looks like:**
- Growth has plateaued
- Market is largely captured
- Incremental improvements over big bets
- Focus shifts to efficiency and retention

**Real examples:**
- Facebook core product (2015-present): Maintaining 3B users
- Microsoft Office (2000-present): Dominant, defending position
- Gmail: Universal adoption, incremental improvements

**PM priorities in Maturity:**

| Priority | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Retention and engagement | Keep what you have |
| Efficiency improvements | Margin matters now |
| Defending against competitors | Others want your market |
| Finding new growth vectors | Adjacent products/markets |

**What PMs should NOT focus on:**
- Massive pivots (too much to lose)
- Ignoring emerging competitors (they're coming)
- Only incremental thinking (miss disruption)

**Key question:** "How do we maintain leadership while finding new growth?"

**The maturity challenge:** Organizations optimize for what got them here, making it hard to respond to disruptive change.

**Success indicator:** Stable or growing market share with healthy margins and emerging growth initiatives.

### Stage 4: Decline

**What it looks like:**
- User base is shrinking
- Revenue is falling
- Market has shifted or been disrupted
- Difficult decisions about investment

**Real examples:**
- BlackBerry (2010-2015): Disrupted by iPhone
- Yahoo core properties: Disrupted by Google, Facebook
- Traditional taxis: Disrupted by Uber, Lyft

**PM priorities in Decline:**

| Priority | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Extracting remaining value | Milk the cow, don't feed it |
| Migrating users | If you have a successor product |
| Identifying pivot opportunities | Can anything be salvaged? |
| Managing sunset | End gracefully if needed |

**What PMs should NOT focus on:**
- Major investment in features (ROI is negative)
- Denial about market reality (face facts)
- Abandoned users (manage the transition)

**Key question:** "How do we manage this responsibly?"

**The decline reality:** Not every product can be saved. Sometimes the best PM decision is knowing when to sunset.

**Success indicator:** Graceful transition with minimized user disruption and maximum value extraction.

### Lifecycle Transitions

Products don't announce which stage they're in. Recognizing transitions requires watching for signals:

**Introduction → Growth signals:**
- Organic user acquisition increasing
- Word-of-mouth mentions
- Retention curves improving
- Revenue or engagement accelerating

**Growth → Maturity signals:**
- Growth rate declining (even if absolute numbers are up)
- Market saturation indicators
- Competitor products reaching parity
- Innovation feeling harder

**Maturity → Decline signals:**
- Users leaving for alternatives
- Core value proposition eroding
- Technological obsolescence
- Market shifts making product less relevant

### The Multi-Product Company

Large companies manage products across all stages simultaneously:

**Apple example:**
- Introduction: Vision Pro (finding audience)
- Growth: Services (Apple TV+, Fitness+)
- Maturity: iPhone (massive, optimizing)
- Decline: iPod (sunset complete)

**PM career implication:** Working at different lifecycle stages builds different skills. Growth PM experience differs dramatically from maturity PM experience.

### Second Curves and Reinvention

Some products escape decline through reinvention:

**Netflix:**
- DVD-by-mail (mature → decline)
- Streaming (introduction → growth)
- Original content (introduction → growth)

**Amazon:**
- Online bookstore (mature)
- Everything store (growth)
- AWS (introduction → growth → maturity)
- Advertising (growth)

**The pattern:** Start the next curve before the current one peaks.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Products move through Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline—each requiring different PM focus**
2. **Introduction is about finding product-market fit; nothing else matters**
3. **Growth requires scaling without breaking; technical debt and process matter**
4. **Maturity demands efficiency and defense while finding new growth vectors**
5. **Decline requires honest assessment and responsible management**
6. **Great companies start new curves before old ones peak**

## Practice

### Reflection Questions
1. Think of three products you use. What lifecycle stage is each in? What evidence supports your assessment?
2. Have you experienced a product's decline as a user? What did that feel like?
3. Why might a PM prefer working on growth-stage products? What about maturity-stage?

### Exercise
**Lifecycle Analysis:**

Pick a company with multiple products (Google, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon).

For each of 3+ products:
1. Identify the current lifecycle stage
2. List 2-3 pieces of evidence supporting your assessment
3. Predict what PM priorities likely are
4. Identify any signals of transition

Example format:
```
Product: Google Search
Stage: Maturity
Evidence:
- 90%+ market share (saturated market)
- Incremental AI features vs. major pivots
- Focus on ad efficiency
PM Priorities: Defending against AI alternatives, monetization optimization
Transition signals: ChatGPT/AI search emerging as potential disruptor
```

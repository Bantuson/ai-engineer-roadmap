### What is Product Strategy?

Product strategy is **the plan for achieving your product vision through deliberate choices about what you will and won't do.**

It sits between high-level vision and day-to-day execution:

```
Company Mission
      ↓
Company Strategy
      ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ PRODUCT VISION  │ ← Where we're going
│       ↓         │
│ PRODUCT STRATEGY│ ← How we'll get there (this lesson)
│       ↓         │
│ PRODUCT ROADMAP │ ← What we'll build when
│       ↓         │
│ FEATURES/TASKS  │ ← Day-to-day execution
└─────────────────┘
```

**Strategy is about choices.** A strategy that doesn't say "no" to something isn't a strategy—it's a wish list.

### Product Vision

The vision describes **the future state you're working toward**—what the world looks like when you succeed.

#### Characteristics of Good Vision

**Inspiring:** Motivates the team through difficult days
**Clear:** Understandable by anyone in the company
**Ambitious:** Stretches beyond current capabilities
**Stable:** Shouldn't change quarterly or yearly
**Achievable:** Challenging but possible

#### Vision Examples

**Good visions:**

- **Tesla:** "Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"
- **Airbnb:** "Create a world where anyone can belong anywhere"
- **Notion:** "Make toolmaking ubiquitous"
- **Figma:** "Make design accessible to everyone"

**Why these work:**
- Describe a better future state
- Don't prescribe specific features
- Could guide decisions for years
- Emotionally resonant

**Bad visions:**

- "Become the leading provider of enterprise SaaS solutions" (generic, uninspiring)
- "Ship 10 new features this year" (tactic, not vision)
- "Maximize shareholder value" (outcome, not direction)

#### Creating Your Vision

Ask these questions:
1. What fundamental problem are we solving?
2. For whom?
3. What does the world look like when we succeed?
4. Why does this matter?

Then distill into one or two sentences that pass the "would I put this on a t-shirt" test.

### Product Positioning

Positioning defines **how your product is perceived relative to alternatives**. It's the space you own in customers' minds.

#### The Positioning Statement

A structured way to articulate positioning:

```
For [target customer]
Who [has this need/problem]
[Product name] is a [category]
That [key benefit/differentiation]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
We [unique value/approach]
```

**Example:**

For small business owners who struggle with bookkeeping,
QuickBooks is an accounting software
That makes finances manageable without accounting expertise
Unlike spreadsheets or hiring accountants
We provide automated categorization and simple interfaces

#### Positioning Decisions

**Target customer:** You can't be for everyone. Who specifically?

**Category:** What box do you want to be placed in?
- New category: Risky but can own it entirely
- Existing category: Easier to understand but crowded

**Differentiation:** What makes you uniquely valuable?
- Must be true (not aspirational)
- Must matter to customers
- Must be defensible

**Competitive frame:** Who are you compared against?
- Direct competitors (similar products)
- Indirect competitors (different solutions, same problem)
- Status quo (doing nothing)

### Competitive Analysis

Understanding competitors informs strategy without dictating it.

#### Types of Competitors

| Type | Description | Example for Slack |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Direct** | Same product, same customer | Microsoft Teams, Discord |
| **Indirect** | Different product, same problem | Email, meetings |
| **Potential** | Could enter your market | Any tech giant |

#### Competitive Analysis Framework

For each significant competitor, understand:

**1. Product:**
- Core features and capabilities
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Recent developments
- Technical approach

**2. Business:**
- Business model and pricing
- Market position and share
- Growth trajectory
- Funding and resources

**3. Customers:**
- Target segments
- Customer satisfaction
- Switching costs
- Loyalty drivers

**4. Strategy:**
- Stated vision and priorities
- Expansion areas
- Partnerships
- Vulnerabilities

#### Competitive Intelligence Sources

- **Public:** Product websites, pricing pages, press releases, job postings, SEC filings
- **Customer:** What customers who evaluated competitors say
- **Sales:** What sales team hears in competitive deals
- **Industry:** Analyst reports, industry publications
- **Social:** Review sites, social media, forums

**Ethics matter:** Gather intelligence legally and ethically. Never misrepresent yourself.

#### Competitive Response

**Don't:**
- React to every competitor move
- Copy competitor features blindly
- Let competitors set your roadmap

**Do:**
- Understand the landscape deeply
- Respond when threats are real
- Find opportunities in competitor weaknesses
- Differentiate rather than imitate

### SWOT Analysis

SWOT provides structured thinking about strategic position:

```
        ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
        │  HELPFUL    │  HARMFUL    │
        │  (to goals) │  (to goals) │
┌───────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│INTERNAL│ STRENGTHS  │ WEAKNESSES  │
│(origin)│             │             │
├───────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│EXTERNAL│OPPORTUNITIES│  THREATS    │
│(origin)│             │             │
└───────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Strengths:** Internal capabilities that help achieve goals
**Weaknesses:** Internal limitations that hinder goals
**Opportunities:** External factors you could exploit
**Threats:** External factors that could cause problems

#### Effective SWOT

**Be specific:**
- Bad: "Strong team"
- Good: "Engineering team with deep ML expertise from Google/Meta"

**Be honest:**
- Include uncomfortable truths
- External validation helps (ask customers, advisors)

**Make it actionable:**
- Leverage strengths
- Address weaknesses
- Capture opportunities
- Mitigate threats

**Example SWOT for a B2B SaaS startup:**

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Fastest product in market (3x competitor) | Small team limits feature velocity |
| Deep expertise in vertical | No brand recognition |
| Customer love (NPS 70+) | Limited sales experience |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| Competitor just raised prices 30% | Big tech could enter space |
| New regulation requires solution | Customer concentration (3 = 50% revenue) |
| Adjacent market has same problem | Key engineer recruiting interest |

### Strategy Development

With vision, positioning, competitive understanding, and SWOT analysis, you can develop strategy.

#### Strategy Components

**1. Where to play:**
- Which customer segments to target
- Which geographies
- Which use cases

**2. How to win:**
- Your sustainable competitive advantage
- How you'll be different
- What bets you're making

**3. What to prioritize:**
- Key initiatives (3-5 major bets)
- Resource allocation
- What you're explicitly NOT doing

#### Strategic Themes

Good strategies often organize around themes that guide prioritization:

**Example themes:**
- "Win enterprise through security and compliance"
- "Make setup so easy anyone can self-serve"
- "Build an ecosystem that creates lock-in"

These themes help the team make consistent decisions without constant PM input.

#### Strategy vs. Roadmap

| Strategy | Roadmap |
|----------|---------|
| Why and where | What and when |
| 1-3 year horizon | Quarters to a year |
| Directional | Specific |
| Rarely changes | Updates regularly |

Strategy informs roadmap. Roadmap is NOT strategy.

### Communicating Strategy

Strategy is useless if the team doesn't understand it.

**Strategy documents should include:**
1. Context (market, competitive landscape)
2. Vision (where we're heading)
3. Positioning (how we're differentiated)
4. Strategic themes (our big bets)
5. Key initiatives (what we're doing about it)
6. What we're NOT doing (explicit trade-offs)
7. Success metrics (how we'll know it's working)

**Keep it concise:** A 50-page strategy document won't be read. Aim for something that can be understood in under 10 minutes.

**Make it accessible:** Available to everyone, referenced regularly, updated when things change.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy is the plan for achieving vision through deliberate choices—including what NOT to do**
2. **Vision describes the better future; positioning defines how you're perceived relative to alternatives**
3. **Competitive analysis informs but shouldn't dictate strategy—differentiate rather than imitate**
4. **SWOT provides structured thinking but must be specific and actionable**
5. **Strategy is NOT roadmap—strategy is stable direction; roadmap is tactical sequence**
6. **Strategy must be communicated clearly and repeatedly to guide team decisions**

## Practice

### Reflection Questions
1. Can you articulate your current product's (or employer's) strategy? If not, what does that suggest?
2. Think of a product that had to pivot. What strategic assumption proved wrong?
3. What's a product with excellent positioning? Why does it work?

### Exercise
**Strategy Development Practice:**

Pick a product you use regularly. Develop a strategy presentation including:

1. **Vision statement** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Positioning statement** (using the template)
3. **Competitive landscape** (2-3 main competitors with key differences)
4. **SWOT analysis** (2-3 items per quadrant)
5. **Strategic themes** (2-3 major bets)
6. **One thing they should NOT do** (explicit trade-off)

Format: 1-2 pages or 5-7 slides

**Bonus:** Share with someone and get feedback. Does the strategy make intuitive sense? Are the trade-offs clear?

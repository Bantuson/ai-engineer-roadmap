# Module 02: Technical Product Management (Deep Dive)

This is a **priority deep-dive module** for anyone working with engineering teams or managing technically complex products.

## Why Technical PM Skills Matter

- **70% of PM roles now require technical fluency** (2025 industry surveys)
- Technical PMs command **15-25% higher salaries** than non-technical peers
- The ability to communicate with engineers is the #1 skill requested by hiring managers
- AI/ML products require deep technical understanding to manage effectively

## Module Overview

| Lesson | Topic | Key Skills |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 01 | Tech Foundations | How software works, architecture basics |
| 02 | Working with Engineers | Communication, collaboration, respect |
| 03 | APIs, Platforms & DX | API design, developer experience |
| 04 | Writing PRDs | Requirements, specs, acceptance criteria |
| 05 | Agile for PMs | Scrum, Kanban, Product Owner role |
| 06 | Technical Trade-offs | Debt, scalability, build vs buy |
| Mini-Project | PRD Writing | Complete a production-ready PRD |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Explain how code moves from development to production
- [ ] Have meaningful technical discussions with engineers
- [ ] Design APIs and think about developer experience
- [ ] Write PRDs that engineers love (clear, complete, testable)
- [ ] Function effectively as Product Owner in agile teams
- [ ] Make informed technical trade-off decisions

## Prerequisites

- Completed: [01-Foundations](../01-foundations/) module
- Helpful: Any programming experience (even basic)
- Helpful: Experience working with software development teams

## Lessons

### [01 - Tech Foundations for PMs](./01-tech-foundations.md)
What PMs need to understand about software development, architecture, and how code reaches users.

### [02 - Working with Engineers](./02-working-with-engineers.md)
Communication strategies, building trust, translating between business and technical, and participating in technical discussions.

### [03 - APIs, Platforms & Developer Experience](./03-apis-platforms-dx.md)
Understanding REST/GraphQL, API design principles, platform thinking, and creating products developers love.

### [04 - Writing PRDs](./04-writing-prds.md)
The art and science of product requirements—structure, user stories, acceptance criteria, and prioritization.

### [05 - Agile for PMs](./05-agile-for-pms.md)
Scrum vs Kanban, sprint planning, the Product Owner role, and backlog management.

### [06 - Technical Trade-offs](./06-technical-tradeoffs.md)
Making decisions about technical debt, scalability, build vs buy, and other engineering trade-offs.

### [Mini-Project: PRD Writing](./mini-project-prd-writing/)
Apply your learning by writing a complete, production-quality PRD for a real feature.

## Time Estimate

3-4 weeks at 1-2 hours per day

## Next Steps

After completing Technical PM:
- Continue to **[03-AI Product Management](../03-ai-product-management/)** for AI/ML product skills
- Use the mini-project PRD in your portfolio
- Apply learnings immediately in your current role

## A Note on Technical Depth

This module aims for **technical fluency, not expertise.** The goal is:

**Not:** Being able to write production code
**Yes:** Understanding enough to have meaningful conversations, make informed decisions, and recognize when something is harder than it seems.

You don't need to become an engineer. You need to be a great partner to engineers.

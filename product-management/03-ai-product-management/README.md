# Module 03: AI Product Management (Deep Dive)

This is a **priority deep-dive module** for managing products with AI/ML components—now essential as AI permeates nearly every software product.

## Why AI PM Skills Matter

The landscape has shifted dramatically:

- **85% of enterprise software** now incorporates AI features (2025)
- **AI PM salaries range from $180k-$420k** at major tech companies—10-40% higher than traditional PM roles
- **Google's APM program** now lists "AI/ML fluency" as an absolute requirement
- **The Anthropic PM role** paying $320k-$405k focuses on building production prompts for Claude products

Whether you're building AI-native products or adding AI features to existing products, these skills are career-critical.

## Module Overview

| Lesson | Topic | Key Skills |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 01 | Why AI PM is Different | Non-determinism, new challenges |
| 02 | AI/ML Fundamentals | What PMs need to know about ML |
| 03 | Data Strategy | Data quality, pipelines, bias |
| 04 | LLM Evaluation | Evals framework, testing AI |
| 05 | Responsible AI | Ethics, safety, regulations |
| 06 | AI Product Lifecycle | Training, monitoring, improvement |
| Mini-Project | AI Feature Design | Design an AI feature end-to-end |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Explain what makes AI products fundamentally different from traditional software
- [ ] Understand ML concepts at the level needed for PM conversations
- [ ] Design data strategies that enable AI feature success
- [ ] Create evaluation frameworks for AI features
- [ ] Incorporate responsible AI principles into product development
- [ ] Manage the unique AI product lifecycle (training, monitoring, iteration)

## Prerequisites

- Completed: [01-Foundations](../01-foundations/) module
- Completed: [02-Technical PM](../02-technical-pm/) module (recommended)
- Helpful: Basic statistics understanding
- Helpful: Any hands-on AI/ML exposure

## Lessons

### [01 - Why AI PM is Different](./01-why-ai-pm-different.md)
The fundamental shift from deterministic to probabilistic systems, new challenges, and the dual metrics problem.

### [02 - AI/ML Fundamentals for PMs](./02-ai-ml-fundamentals.md)
What you need to understand about machine learning—types, neural networks, training, inference—without the math.

### [03 - Data Strategy](./03-data-strategy.md)
Data quality, annotation, pipelines, and detecting bias. Data is the new code.

### [04 - LLM Evaluation](./04-llm-evaluation.md)
How to test AI features—building evals, measuring quality, managing hallucination/latency/cost tradeoffs.

### [05 - Responsible AI](./05-responsible-ai.md)
Ethics, safety, bias mitigation, explainability, and navigating the regulatory landscape.

### [06 - AI Product Lifecycle](./06-ai-product-lifecycle.md)
Training cycles, monitoring production AI, continuous improvement, and human-in-the-loop patterns.

### [Mini-Project: AI Feature Design](./mini-project-ai-feature/)
Design an AI feature for an existing product, addressing the unique challenges of AI.

## Time Estimate

3-4 weeks at 1-2 hours per day

## The Two Faces of AI for PMs

This module covers both dimensions of AI in product management:

### 1. Managing AI Products
Building and shipping products with AI/ML components:
- Recommendation systems
- Search and ranking
- Content generation
- Automation and assistants

### 2. Using AI for PM Work
Leveraging AI tools for PM productivity (40%+ efficiency gains reported):
- Research and analysis
- PRD drafting
- User feedback synthesis
- Competitive intelligence

Module 04 (Prompt Engineering for PMs) covers the second dimension in depth. This module focuses on the first.

## Next Steps

After completing AI Product Management:
- Continue to **[04-Prompt Engineering for PMs](../04-prompt-engineering-pm/)** for AI productivity skills
- Complete the mini-project for your portfolio
- Apply learnings to identify AI opportunities in your current products

## A Note on This Fast-Moving Field

AI capabilities and best practices evolve rapidly. While the principles in this module are durable, specific tools and techniques may change. Stay current through:
- Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google AI blogs
- AI PM communities (Lenny's Newsletter AI coverage, etc.)
- Hands-on experimentation

The goal is building intuition and frameworks that let you evaluate new developments, not memorizing today's specifics.

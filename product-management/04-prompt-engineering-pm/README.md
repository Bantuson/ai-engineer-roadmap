# Module 04: Prompt Engineering for PMs

Learn to leverage AI in your daily PM work and understand production prompt development for AI products.

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters for PMs

Two critical reasons:

### 1. Personal Productivity (40%+ Gains)
PMs who effectively use AI tools report:
- Faster research and competitive analysis
- Quicker first drafts of PRDs and documentation
- Better synthesis of user feedback
- More thorough exploration of edge cases

### 2. Product Development
The Anthropic PM role paying $320k-$405k focuses on:
- Writing system prompts for each Claude model release
- Creating meta-prompts for research pipelines
- Reviewing prompt changes from product teams
- Leading response to behavioral issues in production

Both dimensions matter for modern PM careers.

## Module Overview

| 02 | PM Workflows with AI | Using AI for research, PRDs, analysis |
| 03 | Production Prompts | System prompts, A/B testing, versioning |
| - | Prompt Library | 30+ ready-to-use prompts for PM tasks |

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Apply prompt engineering frameworks (structure, context, examples)
- [ ] Use AI effectively for PM workflows (research, writing, analysis)
- [ ] Understand production prompt development and maintenance
- [ ] Leverage the prompt library for immediate productivity gains

## Prerequisites

- Completed: [01-Foundations](../01-foundations/) module
- Completed: [03-AI Product Management](../03-ai-product-management/) module (recommended)
- Access to an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

## Lessons

### [01 - Prompt Fundamentals](./01-prompt-fundamentals.md)
Core techniques for writing effective prompts—structure, context, examples, and iterative refinement.

### [02 - PM Workflows with AI](./02-pm-workflows-with-ai.md)
Practical applications for research synthesis, PRD drafting, competitive analysis, and more.

### [03 - Production Prompts](./03-production-prompts.md)
How to develop, test, and maintain prompts for production AI features.

### [Prompt Library](./prompt-library.md)
30+ ready-to-use prompts organized by PM task—copy, customize, and use immediately.

## Time Estimate

2 weeks at 1-2 hours per day

## How to Use This Module

### For Personal Productivity
- Start with the **Prompt Library** for immediate wins
- Learn **Fundamentals** to customize effectively
- Apply **PM Workflows** to your daily work

### For Product Development
- Master **Fundamentals** thoroughly
- Study **Production Prompts** for deployment patterns
- Practice iterating on prompts like you iterate on products

## A Note on Responsible Use

When using AI for PM work:
- **Verify facts** — AI can hallucinate; check important claims
- **Add your judgment** — AI drafts need human refinement
- **Protect confidentiality** — Be careful with proprietary information
- **Disclose appropriately** — Know when to mention AI assistance

AI is a powerful tool. Use it wisely.

## Next Steps

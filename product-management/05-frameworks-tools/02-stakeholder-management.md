### Why Stakeholder Management Matters

PMs rarely have formal authority. You can't mandate that:
- Engineering builds what you spec
- Executives approve your roadmap
- Sales stops making promises
- Marketing launches when you want

**You succeed through influence, not authority.**

### Stakeholder Mapping

Before you can manage stakeholders, understand them.

#### The Influence/Interest Matrix

```
                    INFLUENCE
               Low              High
            ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
            │             │             │
       High │   KEEP      │   MANAGE    │
            │ SATISFIED   │   CLOSELY   │
            │             │             │
  INTEREST  ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
            │             │             │
       Low  │   MONITOR   │   KEEP      │
            │  (minimal   │  INFORMED   │
            │   effort)   │             │
            └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Manage Closely (High influence, high interest):**
- Key decision makers who care about your area
- Engage frequently, seek input proactively
- Examples: Your manager, product leader, key engineering leads

**Keep Satisfied (High influence, low interest):**
- Can affect your work but don't pay close attention
- Don't overwhelm them; be ready when they do engage
- Examples: Executives outside your area, board members

**Keep Informed (Low influence, high interest):**
- Care deeply but can't directly affect decisions
- Provide regular updates, make them feel heard
- Examples: Customer support, users, junior team members

**Monitor (Low influence, low interest):**
- Minimal engagement needed
- Don't ignore—interest or influence can change
- Examples: Tangential teams, distant stakeholders

#### Stakeholder Identification

List your stakeholders across categories:

**Internal:**
- Engineering leads and team
- Design leads and team
- Your manager and PM peers
- Executive leadership
- Sales and customer success
- Marketing
- Operations and support
- Finance and legal

**External:**
- Key customers
- Partners
- Vendors
- Investors (if relevant)

#### Stakeholder Profile Template

For key stakeholders, document:

```
Name: [Stakeholder name]
Role: [Their role]
Influence level: High / Medium / Low
Interest level: High / Medium / Low
Quadrant: [Manage closely / Keep satisfied / etc.]

What they care about:
- [Their priorities]
- [Their concerns]
- [What success looks like to them]

Preferred communication:
- [Format: 1:1, email, Slack, formal meeting]
- [Frequency: daily, weekly, monthly]
- [Style: detailed, high-level, data-heavy]

Relationship status: Strong / Developing / Needs work
Notes: [Anything relevant]
```

### Communication Strategies

Different stakeholders need different approaches.

#### For Executives (Keep Satisfied / Manage Closely)

**What they want:**
- Bottom line impact
- Risks and mitigations
- Clear recommendations
- Minimal time investment

**How to communicate:**
- Lead with the conclusion
- Provide context concisely
- Offer options with tradeoffs
- Be honest about unknowns

**Anti-patterns:**
- Burying the lead in details
- Requiring them to connect dots
- Surprising them in public settings
- Over-frequency of minor updates

**Template for executive updates:**
```
Headline: [One sentence: What's the status/ask?]

Context: [2-3 sentences: Why does this matter?]

Current state: [Where are we?]

Recommendation/Ask: [What do you need from them?]

Risks: [What could go wrong?]

Timeline: [Key dates]
```

#### For Engineering (Manage Closely)

**What they want:**
- Clear requirements
- The "why" behind requests
- Technical constraints acknowledged
- Respect for their expertise

**How to communicate:**
- Written specs for complex work
- Collaborative discussions for ambiguous areas
- Responsiveness to questions
- Celebration of their work

**Anti-patterns:**
- Changing requirements frequently
- Not explaining the rationale
- Micromanaging implementation
- Taking credit, assigning blame

#### For Sales/Customer Success (Keep Informed / Manage Closely)

**What they want:**
- To know what's coming (for customer conversations)
- To feel their feedback matters
- Tools to close deals
- Confidence in the product

**How to communicate:**
- Regular roadmap updates
- Feature announcements they can share
- Clear "can/can't promise" guidelines
- Feedback loop acknowledgment

**Anti-patterns:**
- Surprising them (customer asks about feature they don't know about)
- Dismissing customer feedback
- Overpromising in materials they'll share
- Making their job harder

### Influencing Without Authority

PM power comes from:

#### 1. Expertise

Be the person who knows:
- The customer deeply
- The data thoroughly
- The competitive landscape
- The product inside-out

**Build expertise:**
- Talk to users regularly
- Master your analytics
- Read industry sources
- Use your product as a user would

#### 2. Relationships

People do things for people they trust and like.

**Build relationships:**
- Coffee chats and 1:1s (not just about work)
- Learn what matters to them personally
- Follow through on commitments
- Give credit generously

#### 3. Communication Skill

The ability to clearly articulate:
- The problem and its importance
- The proposed solution
- Why it's the right choice
- What you need from others

**Improve communication:**
- Practice presentations
- Get feedback on writing
- Study great communicators
- Adapt to your audience

#### 4. Track Record

Past success builds future credibility.

**Build track record:**
- Deliver on commitments
- Admit and learn from failures
- Document wins (for yourself and others)
- Build references from satisfied stakeholders

### The Art of Saying No

PMs say no constantly. How you say it matters.

#### Good No Patterns

**"Not now":**
"I love this idea. It doesn't fit in this quarter, but I'm adding it to our backlog for Q3 planning."

**"Help me understand":**
"I want to make sure I understand the problem. Can you tell me more about why this is important?"
(Sometimes they'll realize it's not)

**"Trade-off":**
"We can do this. What should we deprioritize to make room? Here are the options..."

**"Redirect":**
"That's not something we can build, but here's an alternative that might address the same need..."

**"Escalate":**
"I see this differently. Can we bring [decision maker] into the conversation?"

#### Bad No Patterns

- "We're too busy" (dismissive)
- "That's a dumb idea" (disrespectful)
- "I already decided" (unilateral)
- Silent no (just ignoring)

### Handling Difficult Situations

#### The Executive Mandate

**Situation:** Exec demands feature that doesn't fit strategy.

**Approach:**
1. Understand their underlying goal (the "why" behind the ask)
2. Explore alternatives that achieve their goal
3. If still mandated, make tradeoffs explicit
4. Document the decision (not to CYA, but for learning)

#### The Stakeholder End-Run

**Situation:** Someone goes around you to get something approved.

**Approach:**
1. Don't get emotional or defensive
2. Seek to understand why they felt the need
3. Address the root cause (communication gap? disagreement?)
4. Establish clearer process for future

#### The Impossible Timeline

**Situation:** Stakeholder demands delivery date that's unrealistic.

**Approach:**
1. Validate the business need behind the date
2. Share what IS achievable in that timeframe
3. Explore scope reductions or phased approaches
4. Escalate if pressure continues

#### The Conflicting Stakeholders

**Situation:** Two important stakeholders want opposite things.

**Approach:**
1. Make the conflict visible (often they don't know)
2. Facilitate discussion between them
3. Find common ground or creative solutions
4. Escalate for decision if needed

### Building Lasting Relationships

#### Regular Touchpoints

| Stakeholder Type | Recommended Frequency |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Direct team | Daily |
| Key partners | Weekly |
| Cross-functional leads | Bi-weekly |
| Executives | Monthly or quarterly |

#### Relationship Maintenance

- **Check in proactively** — Don't only appear when you need something
- **Remember personal details** — Kids, hobbies, milestones
- **Provide value** — Share relevant info they'd find useful
- **Express appreciation** — Thank people publicly and privately
- **Defend them when needed** — Be loyal when it counts

#### When Relationships Break Down

1. **Acknowledge it** — Pretending is worse
2. **Seek to understand** — What went wrong?
3. **Repair if possible** — Direct conversation, apology if warranted
4. **Work around if necessary** — Find other paths
5. **Document for handoff** — Others may need to know

## Practice

### Exercise 1: Stakeholder Map

For your current role (or a hypothetical PM role):
1. List 10 stakeholders
2. Place each on the influence/interest matrix
3. For the top 3 in "Manage Closely," complete the stakeholder profile template

### Exercise 2: Saying No Practice

For each scenario, write a "good no" response:

1. Sales asks for a feature that would take 3 months but promises a big deal
2. Your manager asks why you're not building a feature a competitor just launched
3. An engineer wants to spend 2 weeks refactoring code instead of building features

### Exercise 3: Communication Adaptation

Take a product update and write it for three audiences:
1. Executive summary (3 sentences)
2. Engineering update (technical detail)
3. Sales enablement (customer-facing)

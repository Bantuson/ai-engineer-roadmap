### The Certification Question

**Should you get PM certifications?**

The honest answer: **It depends on your situation.**

**Certifications help when:**
- You're transitioning into PM from another field
- Your target companies value specific credentials
- You want structured learning with accountability
- You need to fill specific knowledge gaps

**Certifications matter less when:**
- You have strong PM experience
- You're at companies that value demonstrated skills over credentials
- You're in a niche where certifications don't exist

**The bottom line:** Certifications can accelerate your learning and signal commitment. They're not substitutes for actual PM experience.

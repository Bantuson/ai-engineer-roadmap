# Capstone Project 01: MVP Launch Simulation

Take a product from concept to launch plan—the full PM lifecycle in one comprehensive project.

## Project Overview

**Scenario:**
You're the founding PM at "FocusFlow," an early-stage startup building a productivity tool for remote workers. You've raised seed funding and have 6 months of runway to find product-market fit.

**Your mission:**
Take FocusFlow from concept to launch-ready. You'll create all the artifacts needed to align stakeholders, guide development, and execute a successful MVP launch.

## Time Estimate

10-15 hours total

## Background

### The Company

**FocusFlow** aims to help remote knowledge workers manage their attention and energy throughout the workday.

**Founding hypothesis:**
Remote workers struggle with focus because:
- Home environment has more distractions
- No physical separation between work and life
- Meeting overload with no recovery time
- Difficulty knowing when to stop working

**Team:**
- 2 co-founders (technical CEO, business COO)
- 3 engineers
- 1 designer (part-time)
- You (founding PM)

**Resources:**
- 6 months runway
- $500K remaining budget
- Small but growing waitlist (2,000 signups)

### Market Context

**Competitors:**
- Traditional productivity apps (Todoist, Notion, etc.)
- Focus apps (Forest, Freedom, etc.)
- Time tracking (Toggl, RescueTime)
- Calendar tools (Calendly, Clockwise)

**Trends:**
- Remote work is permanent for many
- "Productivity anxiety" is a recognized phenomenon
- Wellness features appearing in work tools
- AI features becoming expected

### User Research Summary

From 25 interviews with waitlist members:

**Pain points:**
- "I feel guilty taking breaks but then I burn out"
- "I have no sense of how much focus time I actually have"
- "My calendar is full but I didn't get anything done"
- "I work until I'm exhausted because there's no signal to stop"

**Current solutions:**
- Manual time blocking (inconsistent)
- Pomodoro apps (too rigid)
- Turning off notifications (miss important things)
- Nothing (just struggling)

**Desired outcomes:**
- "Know I'm doing enough"
- "Feel good about my work day"
- "Balance focus time with availability"

## Deliverables

### 1. User Personas (2-3)

Create 2-3 detailed personas representing FocusFlow's target users.

For each persona:
- Demographics and context
- Goals and motivations
- Frustrations and pain points
- Current solutions and workarounds
- Quote capturing their mindset

Use the persona template in `resources/templates/`.

### 2. MVP PRD

Write a complete PRD for FocusFlow's MVP.

Include:
- Problem statement and goals
- Target user (reference personas)
- MVP scope (must-have vs. future)
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Success metrics
- Technical considerations
- Launch requirements

Use the PRD template or your own structure.

**Constraint:** MVP must be buildable by the team in 8 weeks.

### 3. Roadmap

Create a 6-month roadmap in now/next/later format.

**Now (MVP - 8 weeks):**
- What's in the first release?
- Why these priorities?

**Next (Months 3-4):**
- What comes after MVP?
- What will user feedback inform?

**Later (Months 5-6):**
- Longer-term vision
- What depends on finding PMF?

Include outcome goals, not just features.

### 4. Launch Plan

Detail how you'll launch the MVP.

Include:
- Pre-launch activities
- Launch day plan
- Post-launch monitoring
- Success criteria (what metrics = success?)
- Contingency plans

Consider:
- Waitlist of 2,000 as initial users
- Limited team bandwidth
- Need to learn fast

### 5. Metrics Dashboard Design

Define what you'll track and how.

Include:
- North Star Metric (with rationale)
- Supporting metrics (acquisition, engagement, retention)
- How you'll track each
- Targets for 30/60/90 days post-launch
- What actions different metric outcomes trigger

## Getting Started

1. Read all background materials thoroughly
2. Start with personas—they inform everything else
3. Draft MVP scope before detailed PRD
4. Review each deliverable against the rubric
5. Iterate until you're proud of the work

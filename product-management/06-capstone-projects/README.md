# Module 06: Capstone Projects

Build your PM portfolio with three comprehensive projects that demonstrate the skills you've learned throughout this course.

## Why Capstone Projects Matter

**For job seekers:**
- Tangible evidence of PM skills
- Conversation starters in interviews
- Demonstration of initiative and learning

**For practicing PMs:**
- Skills reinforcement through application
- Templates for real work
- Confidence in capabilities

## The Three Projects

| Project | Focus | Demonstrates |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| 01 - MVP Launch Simulation | End-to-end product thinking | Full PM lifecycle |
| 02 - AI Feature Design | AI product management | AI-specific skills |
| 03 - Technical PRD Portfolio | Technical documentation | PRD writing excellence |

## How to Approach These Projects

### Time Investment

Each project takes **8-15 hours** depending on depth.

**Recommended pace:**
- Project 1: Week 1-2
- Project 2: Week 3-4
- Project 3: Week 5-6

### Quality vs. Quantity

Better to do one project excellently than three projects poorly.

**Consider:**
- Completing all three for comprehensive portfolio
- Focusing on one that aligns with target role
- Adapting projects to real opportunities

### Getting Feedback

These projects are most valuable with feedback:
- Share with PM peers or mentors
- Post in PM communities for review
- Use in interview prep with mock interviewers

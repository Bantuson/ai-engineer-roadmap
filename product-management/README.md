# Product Management Course for Technical Teams

A comprehensive, self-study product management course designed for developers, engineers, and technical professionals transitioning into or working alongside product management roles.

## Why This Course?

The landscape of product management is transforming rapidly:

- **85% of enterprise software** now incorporates AI features (2025)
- **70% of PMs** will rely on AI tools in their daily workflow by 2026 (Gartner)
- **AI PM salaries** range from $180k-$420k at major tech companies—10-40% higher than traditional PM roles
- **Technical fluency** is now table stakes: Google's APM program lists "AI/ML fluency" as an absolute requirement

This course bridges the gap between technical expertise and product thinking, with deep dives into Technical PM and AI Product Management.

| 3 | JSON Basics | Load/dump JSON, nested data |
| 4 | CSV Processing | CSV reader/writer, DictReader |
| 5 | Error Handling | try/except, custom errors |
| 6 | Logging | logging module, levels, formats |
| 7 | Regex Basics | match, search, findall |
| 8 | Regex Practical | Extract emails, phones, URLs |
| 9 | Environment Config | Environment variables, dotenv |
| 10 | CLI Arguments | argparse, command-line tools |
| 11 | API GET Requests | requests library, status codes |
| 12 | API POST Requests | POST, headers, authentication |
| 13 | Web Scraping | BeautifulSoup basics |
| 14 | Data Validation | Input validation patterns |
| 15 | Testing Basics | unittest, assertions |
| 16 | Debugging | pdb, print debugging |
| 17 | Pathlib | Modern path handling |
| 18 | Datetime | Dates, times, formatting |
| 19 | Mini Project | CLI tool using all concepts |
| 20 | Capstone | Complete practical project |

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Completed the 30-day Python foundation (or equivalent knowledge of loops, functions, lists, dicts)

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv

# Run any exercise
python day_01_file_reading.py
```

## Daily Format

Each exercise file contains:
1. **Concept explanation** - Brief overview of the topic
2. **Examples** - Working code demonstrating the concept
3. **Exercises** - Practice problems to solve
4. **Challenge** - Stretch goal for deeper learning

## Complementary to 30-Day Foundation

The 30-day foundation covers:
- Basic loops, strings, lists, dicts
- Simple functions, conditionals
- Basic OOP concepts

This 20-day challenge adds:
- File I/O (text, JSON, CSV)
- Error handling and logging
- Regex for text extraction
- Environment and CLI tools
- APIs (GET/POST with requests)
- Web scraping basics
- Testing and debugging
- Modern Python (pathlib, datetime)

## How to Use

1. Complete one exercise per day (2h during PYTHON CHALLENGE block)
2. Read the concept explanation
3. Run the examples to see them in action
4. Complete all exercises
5. Attempt the challenge if time permits
6. Note questions for later research
